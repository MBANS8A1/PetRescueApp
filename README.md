# Pet Rescue (Adoption) Application

## Application Overview

 This application made in Kotlin will allow you to view and read up on different pets that are available for adoption. You can survey the pets on based on their different traits and upon where they are located geographically. Once you have seen a pet that interests you and you would like to adopt it, click the image of it on the home screen; doing this will take you to the details screen for that particular pet. Once you have finished reviewing the information, note down the contact details and click the "Adopt Me" button at the bottom of the details screen, which will take you to the PetFinder Purina :tm: link for that particular pet.
